Hello teacher, my name is Dinh Nguyen Hoang Anh from class COS1203. Here is my coursework project. It is called Jukebox Application. 

To use my Jukebox application, you will need to download the code first: 

1. Grab Git: If you don't already have it, install Git on your computer. You can find it at [link to Git website].
2. Open your terminal: Launch the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
3. Navigate to your download folder: Use commands like cd to move to the directory where you want to save the Jukebox code.
4. Download the code: Copy and paste this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hoanganhdinhh/Jukebox_Final
```
5. Open Terminal or Cmd: Download some python library to make it work well

```
pip install pillow
```
```
pip install pygame
```

6. Open it up: Launch Visual Studio Code (Vscode) and open the downloaded folder. Then, clicking on the track_player.py file.
