My name is Dinh Nguyen Hoang Anh from class COS1203. Here is my coursework project. It is called Jukebox Application. 

To use my Jukebox application, users will need to download the code first: 

1. **Install Git**: If users does not already have it, install Git on your computer. Users can find it at [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. **Open terminal**: Launch the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
3. **Navigate to your download folder**: Use commands like cd to move to the directory where users wants to save the Jukebox code.
4. **Download the code**: Copy and paste this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hoanganhdinhh/Jukebox_Final
```
5. **Open Terminal or Cmd**: Download the necessary Python libraries to ensure the application runs smoothly.

```
pip install pillow
```
```
pip install pygame
```

6. **Open it up**: Launch Visual Studio Code (Vscode) and open the downloaded folder. Then, click on the **track_player.py** file and run it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users needs to install all libraries that the code requires to work properly.
