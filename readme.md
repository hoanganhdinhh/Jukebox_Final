My name is Dinh Nguyen Hoang Anh from class COS1203. Here is my coursework project. It is called Jukebox Application. 

To use my Jukebox application, user will need to download the code first: 

1. **Grab Git**: If user don't already have it, install Git on your computer. User can find it at <a src="https://git-scm.com/"> Git website</a>.
2. **Open your terminal**: Launch the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
3. **Navigate to your download folder**: Use commands like cd to move to the directory where user want to save the Jukebox code.
4. **Download the code**: Copy and paste this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hoanganhdinhh/Jukebox_Final
```
5. **Open Terminal or Cmd**: Download the necessary Python libraries to ensure the application runs smoothly.

```
pip install pillow
```
```
pip install pygame
```

6. **Open it up**: Launch Visual Studio Code (Vscode) and open the downloaded folder. Then, clicking on the track_player.py file and run it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> User needs to install all libraries that the code requires to work properly.
